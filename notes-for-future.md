# Notes for future iterations of the class

1. Assignments can be better integrated (e.g. data structures, label data types, function signatures.) So that one assignment feeds into another directly.
2. Lecture on corpora has space for another 10 or even 15 minutes of content. In particular, information theory study could be explained (along with information theory!)
3. Presentation components should all be graded
4. If asking for comments in the code: ask also to label them somehow.
