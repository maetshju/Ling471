# Notes for future iterations of the class

1. Assignments can be better integrated (e.g. data structures, label data types, function signatures.) So that one assignment feeds into another directly.
2. Lecture on corpora has space for another 10 or even 15 minutes of content. In particular, information theory study could be explained (along with information theory!). Right now, that material is actually in the lecture on visualization stuck in the end. Move to lecture on corpora.
3. Presentation components should all be graded and probably spread out more. Otherwise students forget to submit them.
4. If asking for comments in the code: ask also to label them somehow.
5. Require only the commit URL for submission
6. Consider checking in assignment skeletons into students' private repos? Instead of creating public repos and then asking them not to post solutions etc.
7. Nobody will do the bonus assignment :). Perhaps integrate the neural assignment as an obligatory thing. 
8. Giving students more time for assignments is good but I think I gave them way too much time and they didn't start early enough anyway. So, the neural assignment could certainly be squeezed in.
9. Consider ditching the blog assignment in favor of "reading questions", or entirely (in favor of more assignments). Alternatively, ditch the readings which aren't blogging readings. At any rate, having both is confusing; just have one reading-related set of items.
10. VS Code is not ideal for python. Consider using PyCharm instead.
