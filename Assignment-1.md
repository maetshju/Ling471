## Assignment 1: Preliminaries

In this assignment, you will:

* Download the data you will be working with in all (or most) of the assignments.
* Start thinking about language data in data science and machine learning terms
* Create and start using a personal repository on GitHub where you will store your code for the class.
* Start learning how to program in python and run and test programs using both the terminal and the VS Code IDE
* Write your first python program

### Part 1: The IMDB review dataset
We will be using the IMDB review dataset ([Maas et al. 2011](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P11-1015.pdf))
1. Download the dataset from [here](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).
1. Unpack the dataset by double-clicking on it or by using a utility appropriate for your OS.
1. Read the README file which comes with the dataset.
1. In a text file, answer the following questions about the dataset:
   1. How many movie reviews does it contain?
   1. How is the dataset divided? (Here, talk about how many reivews are in each folder and what does each folder represent, in your own words. Do not copy the text from the README file)
   1. **Why** is it divided in this way? (Make sure to give a thoughtful answer here, at least a paragraph! You may not yet know everything about this, but answer the best you can, based on what you learned in the first couple weeks of class.)
   1. Why is a citation to the ACL paper by Maas et al. included in the README file and in the dataset description on the website? (**What is the relationship of the paper and of the dataset?** Thoughtful, paragraph-length answer here.)
   1.  Why is there a reference to Potts's paper?
   1. Would you say this README file qualifies as a "data statement" (see [Bender and Friedman](https://watermark.silverchair.com/tacl_a_00041.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAn0wggJ5BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJqMIICZgIBADCCAl8GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMDw2APtHtVVWN-T_FAgEQgIICMJJiPYGe86AdkkndbKNqCkMo2DXV54WMBqxsCkxZhHFR244ZkPQPLEAzcvk5QOLNmWQ-I_OYdt_t6kUDrF05VafErnhrEa6iJhePeSUggTryv01s2rO3dgopekdHWdvN4gbajwNN4k3heiTu_avCJPkO7xIwG81qf_KWFfwsgOth1F9UFJIhRudTmCQhDHb_PSu5NSjBvzKJL4ab1KNDrqN8BbHUyAq92lnnRUUWhnBCfMcVeW2e8hcBhmUAm40pCdUw32qcVcjC0ldztvwun5x2oPxtuR_PsCmzAsIHuCoTIdYDpMktBDADRtVmHV0Z-xQuPyNoiMPcGhv05LJGlMSDCooFQeS8dV62h-ZhBKFKqTPBo9TtbUoO6ynZNq0tWlLzP1RpVdMdzUnCO2Kv31css4JNd-oHUqghGC_TcLlSb5jesPNUYOEowxQGbMO5T6tEMe-NssBxeawnHrAw4vGXg0gGVn1klLpgMrXs-i_aoui1k-UH4L-nd6dp3687yt3GbS6KHVOA34B6RcgudaLOW50EbYr4pzOU6Y4FGrPyIDfDxwP_OWpKh5WRFQDKQ7fqZhgErcSouLMTFuXP9VXkztp53mj8kas92wF9Ye3AT9Ov1kdv7ofgsq8IscF8e9NTtWsyvESDoybMKtvTtlHHXM4WcACjYfRxQS6wxXrMSvXJM41jpz8GqMjk2vS-vUVIDZaom0OUKUrUv1GcnhIUzZbIIXBjeI6dMyiLQVYQ) paper which was assigned earlier). If yes, point to the specific portions of the file and map them to corresponding definitions from Bender and Friedman's paper. If no, explain what a data statement could look like for such a dataset or why the concept does not apply here. You can of course argue against data statements here if you like! It is up to you; what counts is the depth and quality of argument.
1. Submit your text file **to Canvas**, in the appropriate area associated with Assignment 1.

### Part 2: Your GitHub repository
In this part of the assignment, you will create a GitHub repository for your code in this class.
1. Create an account on https://github.com/
2. Create a new repository; you can make it private or public. Call it whatever you like, but you will use it for this class. The screenshot below shows what creating a repository looks like on GutHub:

3. After you've created the repository, note its https:// address:

### Part 3: Python and Visual Studio Code.
In this part of the assignment, you will start learning how to program in python and how to use an Integrated Development Environment.
1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), a **free** IDE. Use all the default settings during the installation.
2. Install support for python by clicking on "Python" here:

3. Now, clone the repository you've created in Part 2 into VS Code. Click on "clone a repository" and then enter the https:// address of your repository. Then choose a folder for the local copy of the repository to go to. It can be any folder on your computer, such as one dedicated to this class.
