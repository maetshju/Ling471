# Computational Methods for Linguists

I developed this introductory course in programming and data science for the University of Washington Department of Linguistics in 2021.

Feel free to clone and use to teach your own class!

This repository contains a course structure (as it was in Spring 2021) and five assignment descriptions along with code skeletons.

Please see also "notes for future class iterations", for pitfalls.
