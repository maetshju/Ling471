## Blogging Assignment (throughout the quarter)
This assignment has two parts:

1. Each student will pick ONE "blog option" reading for the whole quarter. By the date that blog entry is due, you will write a 300-500 word post on Canvas (in the "blog" discussion area for that day) summarizing the reading for your classmates. Ideally, these blog posts will convey the main point of the reading, plus a few choice details that you found particularly interesting. You can also add your own perspective, especially if you are skeptical of claims in the reading and/or excited about the findings/ideas therein.
1. Every student not blogging for a particular day is asked to respond to at least one blog post on that day, with a short but contentful comment. Our hope is that these blog responses will turn into discussions. Discussion comments are due by the following lecture.


## Procedure
* By Thursday April 1, everyone should submit their preferences for a reading they are going to be blogging about. Blog options are on Canvas (under **Pages**), but you are also welcome to suggest your own reading (even something you have already read!) that is relevant to the topic of one of the lectures.
* List your preferences in a text file which you will submit to the [**"Assignment 0"**](assign0.md) area on Canvas. **Pick at least two options**, in order of preference. Hopefully most people will get their first choice! (Don't forget you can suggest your own stuff!)
### Blog post due date
* The blog post due date is listed on the syllabus and on Canvas.
* By the due date, post your blog post to the corresponding Canvas discussion area.
### Comments due date
* The comments are due within by the next lecture after the blog post was published. Every student not blogging for a particular day should post a reaction on one of the blogs published that day.
* These reactions can be comments or questions that engage with the content of the blog post or respond to previously posted comments or questions.
### Assessment
Blog posts and discussion comments will be graded on completion, but we are prepared to award extra credit for particularly outstanding blog posts.
