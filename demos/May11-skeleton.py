# Data structure options for creating dataframes: 1) list of lists (each list is a ROW)
# 2) dicts (each key is a column name, each value, which must be a list, is a row)
# Can also create a list of row/column names and pass it to the constructor.
# The index= parameter is for row names; the columns= parameter is for column names.
