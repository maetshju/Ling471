# Syllabus

The course Computational Methods for Linguistics focuses on learning **how data science methods/tools can be applied in the domain of linguistics**. One of the main goals of the course is to familiarize the students with the **basics of programming**, including **general technical versatility skills** required to successfully undertake even the most basic programming tasks. 

### Learning outcomes 
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  
Students will learn about what counts as data in computational linguistics, as well as how linguistic theory and questions dictate which computational methods are employed. Similarly, students will learn about ethical and social implications of data uses in linguistics. Students will learn basic programming concepts and how to learn a range of programs (specific programming language TBD). They will also learn how to use command-line interface and version control. The will learn a range of techniques for data cleaning, representing data as vectors, thoughtfully choosing a model, loading the data into the model, running the model, and interpreting and visualizing results.

### Assessment
The class is organized around a layered project. There are no exams. The project, on which the students will work individually, has 4 parts, which put toghether account for 60% of the grade. Additionally, there is a formal write up worth another 20%. Additionally, students will write blog posts reflecting on the readings; this is worth another 15%. Up to the remaining 5% will be given for participation (such as asking questions during class or on the discussion board).

### Texts
<details>

There are no required textbooks, though there will be plenty of reading, all available online.

Recommended text (for those who have not taken LING200): *Language Files 12*

You may find books like *R for everyone* helpful, or an analagous book on python programming language, but in general we will rely on online resources.

## Academic Integrity
The University takes academic integrity very seriously. Behaving with integrity is part of our responsibility to our shared learning community. If you’re uncertain about if something is academic misconduct, ask the instructor. The Instructor is willing to discuss questions you might have.

Acts of academic misconduct may include but are not limited to:

- Cheating (working collaboratively on quizzes/exams and discussion submissions, sharing answers and previewing quizzes/exams)
- Plagiarism (representing the work of others as your own without giving appropriate credit to the original author(s))
- Copying programming solutions (or parts of them) from other sources including but not limited to StackOverflow and similar websites
- Obtaining answer keys for the assigned homework and consulting them while preparing homework
- Unauthorized collaboration (working with each other on assignments unless permitted by the intructor)

Concerns about these or other behaviors prohibited by the Student Conduct Code will be referred for investigation and adjudication by (include information for specific campus office).

Students found to have engaged in academic misconduct may receive a zero on the assignment (or other possible outcome).

## Disability Accommodations 
Your experience in this class is important. It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law. If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please activate your accommodations via myDRS so we can discuss how they will be implemented in this course.

If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), contact DRS directly to set up an Access Plan. DRS facilitates the interactive process that establishes reasonable accommodations. Contact DRS at (www.disability.uw.edu).

## Safety 
Call SafeCampus at 206-685-7233 anytime – no matter where you work or study – to anonymously discuss safety and well-being concerns for yourself or others. SafeCampus’s team of caring professionals will provide individualized support, while discussing short- and long-term solutions and connecting you with additional resources when requested.

## Religious Accommodations 

Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW’s policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at Religious Accommodations Policy (https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/). Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the Religious Accommodations Request form (https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/).”
